## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Maintenance

- Update getrandom dependency from 0.2.6 to 0.3.3 and migrate from the
  deprecated 'js' feature to the new 'wasm_js' feature for WebAssembly
  compatibility. This ensures proper random number generation in WebAssembly
  test environments with the latest getrandom API.
